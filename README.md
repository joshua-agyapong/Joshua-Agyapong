# [Joshua Agyapong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuaagyapong) | Cybersecurity & IAM Project Portfolio 🔐  

I’m passionate about cybersecurity and enjoy solving complex challenges through hands-on projects. My work spans **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**, **vulnerability management**, and **threat detection**, giving me the chance to explore the fast-moving world of modern security.  
Explore these projects to see how I design, automate, and secure identity systems that help improve operations and reduce risk.
